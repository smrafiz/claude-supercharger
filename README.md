# Claude Supercharger

Shell-level enforcement for Claude Code. Safety hooks that run **outside Claude's process** — before commands execute, invisible to the model, impossible to prompt-engineer around.

## The problem

Prompts are suggestions. Claude is good at finding reasons to ignore suggestions.

Every Claude Code user has a version of the same story: you ask to fix a typo and Claude rewrites the component. You ask a quick question and get an essay. You come back to find files overwritten, commands run, work undone — with no warning.

The fix isn't better prompts. It's moving enforcement somewhere Claude can't reach.

---

## How it works

Two layers with different guarantees.

**Shell hooks run outside Claude's process, before commands execute.** Claude can't see them, can't reason about them, can't be convinced to skip them. Exit code 2 means the command doesn't run. No negotiation.

**Prompt rules in `CLAUDE.md` shape behavior** — roles, economy tier, agent routing. Claude follows these reliably, but not unconditionally.

```
You ──▶ Claude ──▶ Tool call ──▶ [Hook] ──▶ exit 0 or exit 2
                                    │
                                    └── Runs outside Claude's view
```

|  | `/permissions` (inside Claude) | Supercharger hooks (outside Claude) |
|---|---|---|
| Claude sees the rules | Yes | No |
| Can be argued with | Yes | Can't argue with exit code 2 |
| Advisory or enforced | Advisory | Enforced |

This is the line between Supercharger and prompt-only frameworks. SuperClaude, agent-os, BMad modes — all are markdown files Claude reads and chooses to follow. Supercharger ships real hooks that run regardless.

---

## What you get

### Runtime enforcement — can't be bypassed

- **Destructive command blocking** — `rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`, `chmod 777`, `curl | bash`, force-push to main, `git reset --hard`
- **Path guard** — blocks 5 attack categories on Edit/Write: path traversal (incl. URL-encoded `%2e%2e`, null bytes), symlink attacks, `.git/hooks/` writes, writes to `~/.ssh/` / `~/.aws/` / `/etc/`, build artifact injection (`node_modules/.bin/`, `.next/`, `.venv/`). Each category opt-out per project
- **Confidence gate** — blocks Edit/Write/destructive Bash when confidence is low (recent failures, no prior read, repeated attempts). Warns or denies via PreToolUse hook
- **Code security scanning** — `eval()`, `pickle.load()`, SQL injection, weak crypto, hardcoded secrets, GitHub Actions injection
- **Credential leak detection** — scans Bash and Read output for AWS, OpenAI, Slack, Stripe, GCP, Azure tokens before Claude can echo them
- **Prompt injection defense** — scans MCP and web tool output for injection patterns
- **Smart auto-approve** — read-only tools (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `git status`, test runners) bypass confirmation automatically

### Cost & context control

- **Real-time cost tracking** — every tool call rolls up. No end-of-month surprises
- **Budget cap** — set `"budget": 5.00` in `.supercharger.json`. Warns at 80%, blocks non-read tools at 100%
- **Pre-spawn cost forecast** — `[COST] Est. ~$1.90` before subagents run
- **Rate-limit burn projection** — `~52m left at this pace`
- **Bash output compactor** — verbose `git log`, `pytest`, `npm install` output (>50 lines) compressed to a structured summary before it enters context. Failures keep their excerpt; passes show counts. Cuts the most common source of mid-session context exhaustion
- **Cache health monitoring** — warns when cache hit rate drops below 50% (silent re-billing)

### Memory across sessions

- **Reflexion memory** — at end-of-turn, scans for diagnostic markers (`the issue was`, `root cause`, `fixed by`) and writes a structured lesson. On the next prompt, surfaces matching lessons by topic overlap. Per-project, no cross-pollination
- **Auto-decisions capture** — extracts decision statements from your session (`I'll use X because Y`, `decided to`, `chose X over Y`) and persists them in session memory. Restored at next session start so you don't return to a file list — you return to a mental model
- **Stack-derived standards** — detects React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Python, Go, Rust, PHP at session start and injects forbidden patterns, toolchain conventions, and pitfalls
- **Session memory** — modified files, recent commits, economy tier, corrections — injected at next session start
- **PreCompact preservation** — before context compaction, dumps lessons + decisions + transcript backup. Survives `/compact` cleanly
- **Crash-resilient checkpoints** — state saved after every file modification

### Developer experience

- **Statusline** — model, project, branch, stack, tier, agent, MCP profile, context bar, cache efficiency, cost, rate-limit burn — every line
- **8 roles** — `developer`, `designer`, `devops`, `pm`, `researcher`, `student`, `data`, `writer`. Switch with `as developer`
- **Token economy** — 3 tiers (`standard`, `lean`, `minimal`). Switch with `eco lean`. Lean cuts response length ~45% with no information loss
- **9 agent types** — every prompt classified automatically, Claude gets a routing hint without you picking
- **Tool preferences** — `.supercharger.json` `toolPreferences` map redirects `npm` → `pnpm`, `jest` → `vitest`, `pip` → `uv pip`. Suggests instead of blanket-denying. Catches `npx`/`bunx` wrappers
- **Reasoning depth flags** — `--think`, `--think-hard`, `--ultrathink` in any prompt forces extended reasoning (hook detects and injects directive)
- **20+ slash commands** — `/think`, `/sc-status`, `/why`, `/learn`, `/estimate`, `/cleanup`, `/audit`, `/security`, `/stuck`, `/scope`, `/pr`, `/handoff`, `/multi-review`, and more

## Install modes

| Mode | Hooks | Use when |
|--|--|--|
| **Safe** | 19 | Security blocks only. Minimal footprint. |
| **Full** | 87 | Everything: cost tracking, memory, learning loop, statusline, confidence gate. Recommended. |

```bash
./install.sh                                    # interactive
./install.sh --mode full --roles developer      # non-interactive (CI/scripts)
```

`./uninstall.sh` restores your original config from backup.

<summary><strong>Configure</strong></summary>

### Project config

Drop `.supercharger.json` in your repo root. Commit it so your whole team gets the same behavior:

```json
{
  "roles": ["developer", "designer"],
  "economy": "lean",
  "budget": 5.00,
  "profile": "fast",
  "hints": "React + Tailwind, use pnpm"
}
```

### Performance profiles

| Profile | Behavior |
|--|--|
| `standard` | All 83 hooks active (default) |
| `fast` | Skips 8 analytics hooks; keeps code quality and security |
| `minimal` | Skips 11 hooks; security-only |

Security hooks always run regardless of profile.

```bash
SUPERCHARGER_PROFILE=fast claude
# or per-project: {"profile": "fast"}
```

### Opt out of specific features

| Feature | Env var |
|--|--|
| Reflexion memory | `SUPERCHARGER_LESSONS=0` |
| Stack standards | `SUPERCHARGER_STANDARDS=0` |
| Confidence gate | `SUPERCHARGER_CONFIDENCE=0` |
| Path guard | `SUPERCHARGER_PATH_GUARD=0` |
| Tool preferences | `SUPERCHARGER_TOOL_PREFS=0` |
| Bash output compactor | `SUPERCHARGER_BASH_COMPACTOR=0` |
| All advisory hooks | `SUPERCHARGER_ADVISORY_HOOKS=0` |
| Memory injection | `SUPERCHARGER_NO_MEMORY=1` |

Disable security categories: `{"disableSecurityCategories": ["clipboard", "build-artifacts"]}`

Categories: `filesystem`, `database`, `destructive`, `network`, `credentials`, `persistence`, `clipboard`, `browser`, `history`, `selfmod`, `path-traversal`, `symlink`, `git-internals`, `abs-path`, `build-artifacts`.

### Project verify hook

Drop `.claude/verify.sh` in your repo. Claude runs it on stop; failures keep it fixing.

```bash
cp ~/.claude/supercharger/docs/templates/verify.sh .claude/verify.sh
chmod +x .claude/verify.sh
```

## FAQ

**Will this break my existing Claude setup?**
No. The installer backs up everything before touching it. `./uninstall.sh` restores exactly what you had.

**A hook blocked something I actually need.**
`bash tools/hook-toggle.sh <hook-name> off` — or run the command directly in your terminal, outside Claude.

**How do I debug what hooks are doing?**
Hook output is hidden by default. Enable per-project: `touch .supercharger-debug` in your repo root. Enable globally: `touch ~/.claude/supercharger/scope/.debug-hooks`.

**How do I upgrade?**
`bash ~/.claude/supercharger/tools/update.sh`

**Does this send any data anywhere?**
Nothing. No API keys, no external calls, no telemetry. Everything runs locally.

**Can I write my own hooks?**
```bash
bash tools/hook-new.sh my-hook PostToolUse Bash
bash tools/hook-toggle.sh my-hook on
```
